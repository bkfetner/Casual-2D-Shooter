# Casual 2D Shooter Prototype

Welcome to the Casual 2D Shooter Prototype repository! This simple game is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, offering players a basic but engaging experience. The game features 8-directional player control, automatic firing of bullets, and a multitude of enemies in pursuit.

The inspiration for this project comes from the game "Vampire Survivor," which popularized the casual 2D shooter genre. While this prototype captures the essence of the genre, there's still room for innovation and expansion.

## Features

- **8-Directional Control**: Players can move the character in eight different directions, providing fluid and responsive movement.

- **Auto-Firing Bullets**: The player's character automatically fires bullets towards enemies, making gameplay more engaging and action-packed.

- **Numerous Enemies**: The game features a large number of enemies that relentlessly pursue the player, creating a challenging environment.

## Planned Improvements

While this prototype demonstrates the core mechanics of the game, there are several areas for improvement that you can consider working on:

- **Scrolling Backgrounds**: Implement scrolling backgrounds to add depth and visual interest to the game world.

- **Explosion Animations**: Introduce explosion animations to enhance the visual impact of defeated enemies and create a more satisfying experience.

- **Diverse Weapon Types**: Include different weapon types that players can acquire, each with its own unique capabilities.

- **Variety of Enemy Types**: Add various enemy types, each with distinct behaviors and patterns, to increase gameplay variety.

- **Code Organization and OOP**: Refactor the codebase to follow better organization practices and potentially incorporate object-oriented programming (OOP) principles for cleaner and more maintainable code.
